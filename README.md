# InnovationChallenge-ConocoPhillips

In Fall 2020, August Reuben Rodil and I won 2nd place in the ConocoPhillips Innovation Challenge. We were tasked with building a machine learning prediction model with an accompanying frontend interface.

Both of us had little prior experience in machine learning and python, so it was a weekend of major learning and growth. We leveraged the following technologies to build a relationship predictor that, based on a number of attributes, determined the fate of a relationship. Our success wouldn't have been made possible without our AMAZING mentors, Ashley Etter and Brett Sherbert.

- Python,
- Jupyter Notebook,
- Flask, and 
- Bootstrap 

Due to the nature of this challenge, I am unable to share the source code. However, I have included some images of our presentation and program.
